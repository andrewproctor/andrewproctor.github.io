> children on parental labor supply? Could they control for any ommitted variable 
> bias by adding controls?

> *Answer:*
> Angrist and Evans are interested in the effect of family size on labor supply,

> *Answer:*
> To try to identify exogenous (as good as random) variation in family size, 
> Angrist and Evans use whether or not parents' first two children were of the 
> same sex to predict whether or not they had a third child.  
> 
> The hypothesis is that both children being of the same sex is a relevant 
> predictor of having one or more additional children because parents are often 
> thought to have preferences for child gender or gender mix.  If parents want a 
> girl and they have only had boys, they may be more likely to have an additional 
> child. Or they might think that it is beneficial for boys to have sisters and 
> girls to have brothers. To the extent that these preferences do exist, then 
> having the first two children from the same sex should be a relevant predictor 
> of having 3 or more children.
> 
> The argument for validity of the instrument is that birth gender itself is 
> already as good as random, hence having two children of the same sex should 
> also be as good as random.  Since birth gender is random, only a couple of 
> possibilities would seem to pose a potential problem to instrument exogeniety.
> 
> One concern is that having two children of the same sex might tend to have 
> a direct effect on labor supply other than through it's effect on number of 
> children.  Using the controls for having a sex of the first child and the sex 
> child  (boy1st and boy2nd) controls for the direct effects of gender of the first 
> two children, so it is only a unique direct effect of having two children of the 
> same gender that the researcher needs to worry about. This would be true for 
> instance if having two children of the same sex allowed parents to leverage 
> economies of scale (eg less time spent clothes shopping, taking both children to 
> the same afterschool activities, etc).
> 
> A second concern is that although gender of children conceived is as good as 
> random, parents may choose to selectively terminate pregnancies.  If selection 
> is related to gender, then having two children of the same gender will no longer 
> be random.
> 
> *Question:*
> How do the estimates change between OLS and IV? And the standard errors?
> 
> *Answer:*
> Both OLS and IV estimates of family size on labor supply find negative effects. 
> However, the IV estimates of the effect of family size (measured by having 3 or 
> more children) on mother's income is about 40% smaller than the OLS estimates. 
> Similarly, the estimated effect on probability of employment is about 33% (or 4 
> percentage points) smaller.  The effect on hours worked per week is smaller, with 
> estimated effect of -4.2 hours vs -4.5 in OLS.  For  every variable, the standard 
> error of the esimates is smaller in the OLS regression than in IV, as expected.

>  
> *Question:*
> Evaluate the instrument relevance and weakness using the ivreg2 output. Can the 
> test of overidentifying restrictions tell us anything about the instrument 
> exogeneity in this case?
> 
> *Answer:*
> The F-test of excluded instruments is equal to 346.96, indicating that the 
> weak instrument is relevant and far above the F-statistic of 10 used as a rule 
> of thumb to ensure the instrument is not weak.  The underidentification test 
> indicates that the regression has very good size properties.  The test of 
> overidentifying restrictions can not be used for falsification of instrument 
> validity here, since the test requires more than 1 instrument and only 1 is used.
