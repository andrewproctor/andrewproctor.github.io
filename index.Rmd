# Hello!


#### My name is Andrew Proctor and I'm an assistant professor at  <a href="https://www.en.empwi.econ.uni-muenchen.de/index.html" 
  style="color:teal;">Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich</a>.####

I am especially interested in the use of structural and reduced form econometric
methods to better understand human capital investment and the determinants of labor 
market inequality.  

I was previously at PhD student at <a href="https://www.hhs.se/en/research/departments/de/" 
  style="color:teal;"> Stockholm School of Economics </a> and a visiting PhD student at <a href="https://econ.duke.edu/" 
  style="color:teal;">Duke University</a>. 

Before graduate school, I worked briefly in nonprofit and government on 
community development issues, particularly homelessness.
